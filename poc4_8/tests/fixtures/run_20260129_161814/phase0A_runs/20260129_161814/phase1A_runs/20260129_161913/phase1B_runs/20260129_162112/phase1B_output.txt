Now I have the input CSV. Let me also explore the codebase to understand the enforcement mechanisms for each obligation. I need to look at the transactions.py, fork.py, blocks.py, exceptions.py, and other related files to trace the code flows.The files seem to be in a different location. Let me search for the execution-specs or ethereum execution specs directory which typically contains the EIP-2930 implementation:I found them. EIP-2930 was introduced in the Berlin fork. Let me read the relevant files:Now I have a complete understanding of the code. Let me trace through the code flows for each obligation and create the updated CSV. I'll use Python to properly handle the CSV formatting with proper quoting.The file doesn't exist yet since I'm creating a new file. Let me use Bash with Python to properly write the CSV:Now let me verify the output by reading it back and confirming the row count matches the input:
