You are extracting obligations from EIP-1559 and writing a CSV index.

Inputs:
- EIP file: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/specs/EIPs/EIPS/eip-1559.md

Tasks:
1) Read the EIP-1559 text.
2) Split compound obligations into atomic statements.
3) Assign stable IDs in order: EIP1559-OBL-001, EIP1559-OBL-002, ...
4) Tag each obligation with:
   - category (e.g., fees, base fee adjustment, block validation, tx validation, execution semantics)
   - enforcement_type (only if applicable; leave empty otherwise)

Output:
- Write CSV to: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_124906/phase0A_runs/20260129_124906/obligations_index.csv
- Column order must be exactly:
  id, category, enforcement_type, statement, locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap
- The last four columns must be empty initially.
- Use proper CSV quoting (RFC 4180). Any field containing a comma or quote must be quoted.
- Prefer writing the file via a short Python snippet using csv.writer to avoid malformed rows.

Constraints:
- Use the filesystem tools to read the EIP and write the CSV.
- Do not invent obligations; derive them directly from the EIP text.

Completion requirements:
- Read /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/specs/EIPs/EIPS/eip-1559.md with tools.
- Write /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_124906/phase0A_runs/20260129_124906/obligations_index.csv.
- Re-open /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_124906/phase0A_runs/20260129_124906/obligations_index.csv and confirm it exists and has at least one data row.
