I'll help you map the EIP-1559 obligation to implementation locations in the London fork. Let me start by reading the obligations CSV to understand the structure and the specific obligation.Now let me explore the London fork structure to understand the codebase layout:Good! Now I need to search for the GASPRICE opcode implementation. The obligation is about the GASPRICE opcode (0x3a) returning the effective_gas_price. Let me search for GASPRICE in the codebase:Perfect! Now let me read the environment.py file to see the gasprice implementation:Good! I found the `gasprice` function at line 304-324. It pushes `evm.message.tx_env.gas_price` onto the stack. Now I need to trace where `tx_env.gas_price` is set to understand if it's set to the effective_gas_price. Let me search for where tx_env is created and where gas_price is assigned:Excellent! Let me read the fork.py file to see how effective_gas_price is calculated and assigned to tx_env.gas_price:Good! Now let me see where this effective_gas_price is used to create the tx_env:Perfect! Now let me check the function name and context around line 789 to understand the complete flow:Let me find the function name:Good! Now let me also check the check_transaction function to see where effective_gas_price is calculated:
