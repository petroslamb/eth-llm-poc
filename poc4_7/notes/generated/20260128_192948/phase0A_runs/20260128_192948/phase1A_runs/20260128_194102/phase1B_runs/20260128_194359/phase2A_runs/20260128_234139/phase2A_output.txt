I'll help you map the EIP-1559 obligations to the geth implementation. Let me start by reading the Phase 1B CSV to understand the structure and obligations.Now I'll create a todo list to track the work for mapping these 34 obligations to geth implementation:Let me start by exploring the geth codebase to understand its structure and locate EIP-1559 related files:Now let me look for core implementation files in geth, focusing on the consensus and core packages:Perfect! Now let me read the key implementation files:Let me now look at more specific files related to GASPRICE opcode, transaction types, and header validation:Now let me search for the GASPRICE opcode implementation:Let me search for opcode 0x3a directly:Good! Now let me find where GASPRICE opcode is implemented. Let me check the jump table:Perfect! Now let me find the opGasprice function:Excellent! Now I have enough information to start mapping the obligations. Let me update the todo list and use the Task tool to perform a comprehensive mapping since this requires detailed analysis across many files:Now let me use a specialized agent to help map the remaining obligations efficiently:Excellent! Now let me compile all the information and create the comprehensive mapping. Based on my analysis and the agent's findings, I'll now create a Python script to generate the output CSV with all the mappings:Now let me run the script to generate the output CSV:Perfect! Let me verify the output file was created correctly:Excellent! The CSV was created successfully. Let me also check a few sample rows to verify the mappings are complete:Perfect! Let me update the todo list to mark completion:
