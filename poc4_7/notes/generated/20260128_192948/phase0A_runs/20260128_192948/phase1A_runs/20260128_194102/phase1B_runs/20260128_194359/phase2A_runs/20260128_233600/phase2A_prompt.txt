You are mapping EIP-1559 obligations to geth implementation locations and code flow.

Inputs:
- Obligations CSV (Phase 1B output): /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260128_192948/phase0A_runs/20260128_192948/phase1A_runs/20260128_194102/phase1B_runs/20260128_194359/obligations_index.csv
- geth root: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/clients/execution/geth

Tasks:
1) Create a new CSV derived from the Phase 1B CSV that adds four columns:
   - client_locations
   - client_code_flow
   - client_obligation_gap
   - client_code_gap
2) For each obligation row, locate all relevant geth code paths that implement the obligation.
   - Start with targeted searches for the EIP number (e.g., 1559 / EIP-1559) and
     keywords from the statement and code_flow columns.
   - Use initial matches to expand to surrounding code, dependencies, and call sites.
3) Fill client_locations with a best-effort list of concrete references.
4) Fill client_code_flow with a concise summary of the geth execution path.
5) Leave client_obligation_gap and client_code_gap empty in this phase.

Locations format:
- Use a bracketed list, e.g. [path/file.go:L10-L42, path/other.go:FunctionName]

Output:
- Write CSV to: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260128_192948/phase0A_runs/20260128_192948/phase1A_runs/20260128_194102/phase1B_runs/20260128_194359/phase2A_runs/20260128_233600/client_obligations_index.csv

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Do not delete or reorder rows.
- Do not modify the Phase 1B columns; only add and fill the client_* columns.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.
