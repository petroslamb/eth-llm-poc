I'll help you map EIP-1559 obligations to geth implementation locations and code flow. Let me start by reading the Phase 1B CSV to understand the obligations structure.Now let me check the geth repository structure to understand where EIP-1559 implementation code is located:Let me search more specifically for EIP-1559 related code:Good! Now let me search for specific EIP-1559 components in key files. Let me create a comprehensive search strategy using a task agent to help with this complex mapping:Excellent! Now let me read key files to verify and get exact line numbers for mapping to each obligation. Let me start systematically:Now let me read more key sections:Let me continue reading more key sections:Good progress! Let me read a few more key sections:Perfect! Now let me search for intrinsic gas calculation and receipt encoding:Let me look at receipt encoding:Excellent! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a Python script to generate the CSV with mappings:
