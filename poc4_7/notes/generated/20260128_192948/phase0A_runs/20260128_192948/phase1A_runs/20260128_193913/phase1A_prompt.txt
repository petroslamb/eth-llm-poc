You are mapping EIP-1559 obligations to implementation locations in the London fork.

Inputs:
- Obligations CSV: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260128_192948/phase0A_runs/20260128_192948/obligations_index.csv
- London fork root: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/specs/execution-specs/src/ethereum/forks/london

Tasks:
1) For each obligation row, locate all code paths that implement the obligation.
2) Ensure you capture all viable paths, not just the most direct one.
3) Write a list of locations in the locations column for each row.

Locations format:
- Use a bracketed list, e.g. [path/file.py:L10-L42, path/other.py:function_name]

Output:
- Update CSV at: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260128_192948/phase0A_runs/20260128_192948/phase1A_runs/20260128_193913/obligations_index.csv

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Do not delete or reorder rows.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.


Only update the row with id 'EIP1559-OBL-001'. Leave all other rows unchanged.
