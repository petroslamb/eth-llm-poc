You are completing code flow and gap analysis for EIP-2930 obligations.

Inputs:
- Obligations CSV: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_161814/phase0A_runs/20260129_161814/phase1A_runs/20260129_161913/obligations_index.csv

Tasks:
1) For each obligation row, write the end-to-end code_flow text.
   - The flow must include the enforcement hop (the predicate check or the line that raises/returns an error),
     and at least one entry point that leads to it.
2) Fill enforcement_type if missing.
3) Identify gaps:
   - obligation_gap: missing or ambiguous spec requirement.
   - code_gap: missing or unclear implementation path.

Output:
- Update CSV at: /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_161814/phase0A_runs/20260129_161814/phase1A_runs/20260129_161913/phase1B_runs/20260129_162112/obligations_index.csv

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Keep prior columns intact and only fill missing fields.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.
- Do not speculate. If you cannot confirm an enforcement location, leave code_flow minimal and record the uncertainty in code_gap.

Completion requirements:
- Read /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_161814/phase0A_runs/20260129_161814/phase1A_runs/20260129_161913/obligations_index.csv with tools.
- Write /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_161814/phase0A_runs/20260129_161814/phase1A_runs/20260129_161913/phase1B_runs/20260129_162112/obligations_index.csv.
- Re-open /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_161814/phase0A_runs/20260129_161814/phase1A_runs/20260129_161913/phase1B_runs/20260129_162112/obligations_index.csv and confirm it exists and row count matches /Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_161814/phase0A_runs/20260129_161814/phase1A_runs/20260129_161913/obligations_index.csv.
