I'll help you extract obligations from EIP-1559 and create a CSV index. Let me start by reading the EIP file.Now I'll analyze the EIP-1559 text and extract obligations, splitting compound statements into atomic ones. Let me create the CSV file with the extracted obligations.Perfect! I've successfully extracted obligations from EIP-1559 and created the CSV index. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Summary

**Total obligations extracted: 37**

### Obligations by Category:
- **tx validation** (15 obligations): Transaction validation rules including signature verification, balance checks, fee validation, and normalization rules
- **fees** (6 obligations): Fee calculation and distribution rules including priority fees, effective gas price, refunds, and burning
- **base fee adjustment** (7 obligations): Rules for adjusting the base fee based on block congestion and fork block initialization
- **block validation** (5 obligations): Block-level validation rules for gas limits and cumulative gas usage
- **execution semantics** (4 obligations): EVM opcode behavior and transaction type requirements

### Key Features:
1. **Atomic statements**: Compound obligations were split into individual, testable statements
2. **Stable IDs**: Sequential IDs from EIP1559-OBL-001 to EIP1559-OBL-037
3. **Category tags**: Each obligation is tagged with its appropriate category
4. **Empty fields**: The last four columns (locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap) are left empty as specified
5. **Enforcement type**: Left empty as most obligations don't have a specific enforcement type designation in the EIP

The CSV file has been written to the specified path and is ready for further analysis and code tracing.
