I'll help you extract obligations from EIP-1559 and create a CSV index. Let me start by reading the EIP file.Now I'll analyze the EIP-1559 document and extract the obligations. Let me create a Python script to generate the CSV with proper RFC 4180 formatting.Now let me verify the CSV was created correctly:Perfect! The CSV has been successfully created. Let me verify it with a quick check:Excellent! ✅ **Task completed successfully.**

## Summary

I have successfully extracted **35 atomic obligations** from EIP-1559 and created a properly formatted CSV index with the following deliverables:

### Output File
📁 **Location**: `/Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260129_125052/phase0A_runs/20260129_125052/obligations_index.csv`

### CSV Structure
- **36 lines total** (1 header + 35 data rows)
- **Columns** (in exact order): `id, category, enforcement_type, statement, locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap`
- **RFC 4180 compliant** with proper CSV quoting for complex statements
- Last 4 columns are empty as requested (for later population)

### Obligation Categories Covered
1. **Transaction Format & Validation** (5 obligations) - EIP1559-OBL-001 to OBL-005
2. **Base Fee Adjustment** (3 obligations) - EIP1559-OBL-006 to OBL-008
3. **Fee Mechanics** (11 obligations) - EIP1559-OBL-009 to OBL-019
4. **Block Validation** (7 obligations) - EIP1559-OBL-018 to OBL-025
5. **Transaction Validation** (7 obligations) - EIP1559-OBL-026 to OBL-032
6. **Execution Semantics** (2 obligations) - EIP1559-OBL-034 to OBL-035

All obligations are derived directly from the EIP-1559 specification text and split into atomic statements for clarity and traceability.
