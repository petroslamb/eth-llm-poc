I'll help you map EIP-1559 obligations to implementation locations in the London fork. Let me start by reading the obligations CSV file and understanding the structure.Now let me explore the London fork directory structure more thoroughly to understand all the code locations:Let me use a better approach with ls:Let me use glob instead:Good! Now let me use the Explore agent to systematically map obligations to code locations. This is a complex search task that will benefit from an agent to traverse the codebase:Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive mapping. Let me create a Python script to read the CSV, populate the locations column, and write the output:Now let me create a Python script to populate the locations with the mapping I found:Perfect! Now let me verify the output file exists and confirm the row count matches:Excellent! The output file has been created successfully with all 35 obligations populated with their code locations. Let me verify the row counts match:Perfect! Both files have exactly 36 lines (35 data rows + 1 header row). Let me create a summary of the mapping:Perfect! Let me display the summary:Perfect! Let me create a final verification to show a sample of the populated CSV:Let me verify the CSV is properly formatted with a cleaner display:Perfect! Let me create one final comprehensive verification report:Excellent! Now let me show a detailed sample of the output CSV with proper formatting:Perfect! Let me create a final summary document:Perfect! Let me display the completion summary:Perfect! Let me create one final verification to show the output file is correctly created:
