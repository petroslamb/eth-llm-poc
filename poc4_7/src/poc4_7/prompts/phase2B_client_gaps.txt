You are completing {client_name} gap analysis for {eip_label} obligations.

Inputs:
- Client obligations CSV (Phase 2A output): {input_csv}
- client root: {client_root}

Tasks:
1) For each obligation row, review client_locations and client_code_flow.
2) Expand searches in the client codebase if needed to validate coverage or discover missing pieces.
3) Identify gaps:
   - client_obligation_gap: client behavior found that is not represented by the obligation statement(s).
   - client_code_gap: missing or unclear client implementation for the obligation statement(s).
4) If new relevant code is discovered, update client_locations and client_code_flow.

Output:
- Update CSV at: {output_csv}

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Keep prior columns intact and only update client_* fields.
- If client_locations remains empty, record the reason in client_code_gap or client_obligation_gap.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.
- Verify that each client_location contains the key predicate/constant; otherwise remove it and record the gap.

Completion requirements:
- Read {input_csv} with tools.
- Write {output_csv}.
- Re-open {output_csv} and confirm it exists and row count matches {input_csv}.
