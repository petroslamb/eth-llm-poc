You are mapping {eip_label} obligations to {client_name} implementation locations and code flow.

Inputs:
- Obligations CSV (Phase 1B output): {input_csv}
- client root: {client_root}

Tasks:
1) Create a new CSV derived from the Phase 1B CSV that adds four columns:
   - client_locations
   - client_code_flow
   - client_obligation_gap
   - client_code_gap
2) For each obligation row, locate all relevant client code paths that implement the obligation.
   - Start with targeted searches for the EIP number (e.g., {eip_number} / {eip_label}) and
     keywords from the statement and code_flow columns.
   - Use initial matches to expand to surrounding code, dependencies, and call sites.
3) Fill client_locations with a best-effort list of concrete references, including the enforcement point.
4) Fill client_code_flow with a concise summary of the client execution path.
   - The flow must include the enforcement hop (predicate check or error) and an entry point.
5) Leave client_obligation_gap and client_code_gap empty in this phase.

Locations format:
- Use a bracketed list, e.g. [path/file.go:L10-L42, path/other.go:FunctionName]

Output:
- Write CSV to: {output_csv}

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Do not delete or reorder rows.
- Do not modify the Phase 1B columns; only add and fill the client_* columns.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.
- Do not include a location unless the file contains the key predicate/constant relevant to the obligation.

Completion requirements:
- Read {input_csv} with tools.
- Write {output_csv}.
- Re-open {output_csv} and confirm it exists and row count matches {input_csv}.
