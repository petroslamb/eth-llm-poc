You are extracting obligations from {eip_label} and writing a CSV index.

Inputs:
- EIP file: {eip_path}

Tasks:
1) Read the {eip_label} text.
2) Split compound obligations into atomic statements.
   - If a requirement lists multiple constraints (e.g., upper + lower bounds, minimums),
     split them into separate obligations; do not drop any constraint.
3) Assign stable IDs in order: {eip_id_prefix}-OBL-001, {eip_id_prefix}-OBL-002, ...
4) Tag each obligation with:
   - category (e.g., fees, base fee adjustment, block validation, tx validation, execution semantics)
   - enforcement_type (only if applicable; leave empty otherwise)

Output:
- Write CSV to: {output_csv}
- Column order must be exactly:
  id, category, enforcement_type, statement, locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap
- The last four columns must be empty initially.
- Use proper CSV quoting (RFC 4180). Any field containing a comma or quote must be quoted.
- Prefer writing the file via a short Python snippet using csv.writer to avoid malformed rows.

Constraints:
- Use the filesystem tools to read the EIP and write the CSV.
- Do not invent obligations; derive them directly from the EIP text.

Completion requirements:
- Read {eip_path} with tools.
- Write {output_csv}.
- Re-open {output_csv} and confirm it exists and has at least one data row.
