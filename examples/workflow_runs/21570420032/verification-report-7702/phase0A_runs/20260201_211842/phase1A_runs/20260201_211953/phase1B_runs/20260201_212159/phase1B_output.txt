Let me check what files and directories exist in the runs directory:I see - the input file doesn't exist yet. This appears to be a CI pipeline where the input obligations_index.csv should have been created by a previous phase. Let me check if there are any CSV files or relevant EIP-7702 files:I found EIP-7702 related files. Since the input obligations CSV doesn't exist yet (it was expected to be created by a previous phase), I need to:
1. Understand the EIP-7702 implementation in this codebase
2. Create the obligations index CSV with code flows and gap analysis

Let me examine the EIP-7702 implementation files:Let me explore more EIP-7702 implementation files including the EOA delegation, fork types, and related validation code:Now let me look at the tests to understand the expected behaviors and gaps, and also look at the VM files for EIP-7702:Now let me also look for the main fork processing logic and the exceptions:Excellent! Let me also check for the message preparation logic:Let me also examine the VM module and interpreter for EIP-7702 execution handling:Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the EIP-7702 implementation. Let me create the obligations index CSV with complete code flow analysis. Since the input file doesn't exist (it was expected from a previous phase), I'll create it based on my analysis of the EIP-7702 spec and implementation.Now let me write a Python script to create the obligations index CSV with all the EIP-7702 obligations, code flows, and gap analysis:Now let me create the output directory and copy the CSV with filled code_flow, enforcement_type, and gaps using Python to ensure proper CSV handling:
