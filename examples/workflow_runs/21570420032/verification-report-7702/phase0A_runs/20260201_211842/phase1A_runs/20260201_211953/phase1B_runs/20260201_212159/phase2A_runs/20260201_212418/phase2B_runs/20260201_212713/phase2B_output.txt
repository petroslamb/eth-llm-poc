Let me read more of the file to see if there are additional rows:Good - the file has exactly 50 lines (1 header + 48 data rows). Now I need to analyze the client codebase to validate the existing locations, discover missing pieces, and identify gaps. Let me start searching for EIP-7702 related code in geth:The search confirms that `SetCodeTxType` and `AuthorizationList` are not implemented in geth. Let me search for the key files mentioned in the client_locations to verify they exist and examine their content:Let me read more of the key files to verify the referenced locations:Let me continue reading more files to validate locations:Let me read a few more files to verify the claimed locations, and search for related code:Now let me check the StateDB SetCode function and RevertToSnapshot:Now let me check a few more file locations that were referenced:Now let me look for any EmptyCodeHash constant and check the state_transition refundGas function:Now let me ensure the output directory exists and create it if not:Now I'll write a Python script to parse the CSV, validate and update the client locations, and output the updated CSV:Now let me verify the output file was created correctly and has matching row count:The output file is created. Now let me verify the row counts match:Both files have 49 lines (1 header + 48 data rows). Let me also verify using Python to ensure the CSV structure is valid:The gap analysis is complete. Here's a summary of the results:

## Summary of EIP-7702 Geth Gap Analysis

**Input:** 48 obligation rows from Phase 2A
**Output:** 48 rows with updated client gap analysis

### Key Findings:

1. **EIP-7702 is NOT IMPLEMENTED in geth**
   - No `SetCodeTxType` (0x04) constant - only supports tx types 0x00 through 0x03 (BlobTxType)
   - No authorization list processing logic
   - No delegation indicator (0xef0100) handling
   - No MAGIC (0x05) signing prefix
   - No `PER_AUTH_BASE_COST` (12500) or `PER_EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST` (25000) constants

2. **All 48 obligations have `client_code_gap` populated** indicating the missing implementation

3. **One partial implementation (OBL-041):**
   - The `ErrSenderNoEOA` check exists but lacks delegation indicator exemption
   - Currently rejects ALL accounts with code, but EIP-7702 requires allowing accounts with valid delegation indicators

4. **Client locations validated:**
   - Most locations point to related existing code that would need to be extended
   - 4 obligations have empty `client_locations` (`[]`) because the required code simply doesn't exist at all

5. **Files verified to exist and contain related code:**
   - `core/types/transaction.go` - tx type handling (only up to BlobTxType)
   - `core/state_transition.go` - tx validation and execution
   - `core/vm/evm.go` - Call/CallCode/DelegateCall/StaticCall
   - `core/state/statedb.go` - state management (SetCode, RevertToSnapshot, access lists)
   - `params/protocol_params.go` - gas constants (missing EIP-7702 constants)
