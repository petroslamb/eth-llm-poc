The initial search for "7702" didn't find meaningful EIP-7702 implementation code. Let me search for more specific terms related to the EIP.This geth codebase doesn't appear to have EIP-7702 implemented yet. The transaction types only go up to `BlobTxType = 0x03`, with no SetCodeTxType (0x04). Let me do more comprehensive searches to confirm this and look for any related code.Let me search more comprehensively for any EIP-7702 related features:Let me check more files to look for any EIP-7702 related code and also check the core/error.go and interpreter.go files:Based on my analysis, this geth codebase does **not** have EIP-7702 implemented. The transaction types only go up to `BlobTxType = 0x03`, without `SetCodeTxType = 0x04`. The EIP-7702 specific features like:
- Authorization list processing
- Delegation indicators (0xef0100 prefix)
- PER_AUTH_BASE_COST / PER_EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST constants
- Set code transaction type (0x04)

...are not present in this codebase.

Now I need to proceed to generate the CSV as requested, mapping each obligation to the closest relevant code in geth (even though EIP-7702 is not implemented). I'll note that each obligation has a client gap (not implemented). Let me read more key files to understand the existing architecture:Now I have a good understanding of the geth codebase. EIP-7702 is **not yet implemented** in this version. I'll create the CSV with appropriate mappings to the closest relevant code sections, noting that client implementation gaps exist. Let me write a Python script to create the CSV:Now let me verify the output CSV exists and has the correct row count:Now let me verify the row count matches between input and output:The task is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

I have successfully mapped EIP-7702 obligations from the Phase 1B CSV to geth implementation locations and created the Phase 2A output CSV.

### Key Finding: EIP-7702 is NOT implemented in this geth codebase

The analyzed geth version only supports transaction types up to `BlobTxType (0x03)`. The EIP-7702 `SetCodeTxType (0x04)` and all associated features are **not yet implemented**:

- No `SetCodeTxType` constant
- No authorization list processing
- No delegation indicator (0xef0100) handling
- No `MAGIC (0x05)` constant
- No `PER_AUTH_BASE_COST` or `PER_EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST` constants
- No delegation resolution in CALL/CALLCODE/DELEGATECALL/STATICCALL

### Output CSV Details

**Location:** `runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_211842/phase1A_runs/20260201_211953/phase1B_runs/20260201_212159/phase2A_runs/20260201_212418/client_obligations_index.csv`

**Row count:** 49 (1 header + 48 data rows) - matches input

**New columns added:**
1. `client_locations` - References to closest related geth code paths (e.g., `[core/types/transaction.go:L197-L214]`)
2. `client_code_flow` - Summary explaining implementation status (all marked as "NOT IMPLEMENTED" or "PARTIAL" with explanations of what existing code exists)
3. `client_obligation_gap` - Left empty as per instructions
4. `client_code_gap` - Left empty as per instructions

### Mappings Approach

For each obligation, I mapped to the closest relevant existing code that would need modification when EIP-7702 is implemented:
- Transaction type definitions → `core/types/transaction.go`
- State transitions → `core/state_transition.go`
- EVM call operations → `core/vm/evm.go`
- Signature handling → `core/types/transaction_signing.go`
- State DB operations → `core/state/statedb.go`
- Protocol parameters → `params/protocol_params.go`
- Crypto operations → `crypto/signature_cgo.go`
