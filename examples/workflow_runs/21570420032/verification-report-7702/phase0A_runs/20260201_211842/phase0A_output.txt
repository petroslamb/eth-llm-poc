Now I'll analyze the EIP-7702 text and extract the obligations. Let me identify the key requirements and constraints:

**Key Obligations from EIP-7702:**

1. **Transaction Validation:**
   - Transaction is invalid if `authorization_list` length is zero (line 82)
   - Transaction is invalid if auth fields exceed bounds (lines 84-94)
   - `destination` must not be null (line 74)

2. **Authorization Tuple Field Bounds (lines 87-94):**
   - `chain_id` must be < 2^256
   - `nonce` must be < 2^64
   - `address` length must be 20 bytes
   - `y_parity` must be < 2^8
   - `r` must be < 2^256
   - `s` must be < 2^256

3. **Processing Behavior (lines 101-128):**
   - Authorization list processed before execution, after sender nonce increment
   - Chain ID must be 0 or current chain ID
   - Nonce must be < 2^64 - 1
   - `s` must be ≤ secp256k1n/2 (EIP-2)
   - Authority must be added to accessed_addresses
   - Authority code must be empty or already delegated
   - Authority nonce must equal tuple nonce
   - Refund if authority not empty
   - Set delegation indicator or clear code if address is zero
   - Increment authority nonce

4. **Gas Costs:**
   - Intrinsic cost inherited from EIP-2930 + PER_EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST * auth list length
   - Cold/warm access costs for delegation resolution

5. **Execution Semantics:**
   - Delegation affects CALL, CALLCODE, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL
   - CODESIZE and CODECOPY operate on delegated code
   - Precompiles as delegation targets execute empty code
   - Delegation chains not followed (only first code retrieved)
   - Delegation indicators not rolled back on tx failure

6. **Transaction Origination:**
   - EOAs with valid delegation indicator can originate transactions
   - EOAs with other code cannot originate transactions

Now I'll write the CSV file using Python to ensure proper RFC 4180 formatting:Now let me verify the file exists and has the expected content:The CSV file has been successfully created and verified. Here's a summary:

## Summary

**File Created:** `/home/runner/work/eth-llm-poc/eth-llm-poc/runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_211842/obligations_index.csv`

**Total Obligations Extracted:** 48

**Categories breakdown:**
- **tx validation** (10 obligations): Transaction validity checks including authorization list requirements, field bounds, and signature verification
- **execution semantics** (27 obligations): Runtime behavior including authorization processing order, delegation indicator handling, opcode behavior (CALL, CODESIZE, etc.), and state changes
- **fees** (8 obligations): Gas cost calculations including intrinsic costs, cold/warm account access costs, and parameter values
- **block validation** (3 obligations): Protocol constants (SET_CODE_TX_TYPE, MAGIC, etc.)

**Key aspects captured:**
1. Authorization tuple field bounds split into atomic constraints (chain_id, nonce, address, y_parity, r, s)
2. Processing order requirements separated (before execution, after sender nonce increment)
3. Gas costs decomposed into base intrinsic cost formula + authorization list cost
4. Delegation behavior for each affected opcode (CALL, CALLCODE, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL)
5. Special cases (precompiles, delegation chains, zero address clearing)
6. EIP-2 and EIP-2929 cross-references preserved

**Column structure:**
- id, category, enforcement_type, statement, locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap
- Last four columns are empty as specified
- Proper RFC 4180 CSV quoting applied (fields with commas are quoted)
