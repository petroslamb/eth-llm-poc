Let me explore the directory structure to find the correct path:The input file doesn't exist. The path specified in the task (`runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/obligations_index.csv`) does not exist in the current working directory. Let me search more broadly:There's no current `runs/ci_run/...` path. The task mentions a specific path that doesn't exist yet. Given this is a CI run context, I need to create the input CSV file based on EIP-7702 obligations analysis. Let me check if there's a recent run in a CI context:The files exist in the parent directory. Let me read the input file:Now let me read the current output file to see if there's existing content to build upon:Good. Now I need to explore the codebase to trace the code flows for each obligation. Let me start by reading the relevant source files to understand the enforcement points:EIP-7702 is in Prague fork. Let me read the relevant source files:Now let me read the fork.py and other relevant files to trace the entry points and enforcement locations:Now let me read the system.py for CALL instructions and environment.py for CODESIZE/CODECOPY:Now I have enough context to create the code_flow and gap analysis. Let me write a Python script to process the CSV and add the code_flow, enforcement_type, and gap information:Now let me verify the output by reading it and confirming the row count matches:Now let me verify the row counts match between input and output:I have successfully completed the code flow and gap analysis for the EIP-7702 obligations:

## Summary

**Task Completed:**
- Read the input CSV from `runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/obligations_index.csv`
- Analyzed 40 EIP-7702 obligations by tracing through the Prague fork codebase
- Updated the output CSV at `runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/phase1B_runs/20260201_230513/obligations_index.csv`

**Fields Filled:**
1. **code_flow**: End-to-end code paths from entry points to enforcement locations for all 40 obligations
2. **enforcement_type**: Categorized enforcement mechanisms including:
   - `type-identifier` - Transaction type byte enforcement
   - `struct-definition` - RLP serialization structure enforcement  
   - `explicit-check` - Conditional checks that raise errors or skip processing
   - `type-constraint` - Type system constraints (U256, U64, Bytes20, etc.)
   - `crypto-verification` - Cryptographic signature verification
   - `control-flow-ordering` - Execution order requirements
   - `state-mutation` - State modification operations
   - `gas-calculation` / `gas-charging` - Gas cost enforcement
   - `delegation-resolution` - Delegation indicator following
   - `implicit-ordering` / `implicit-context` - Implicit behavioral requirements
   - `encoding` - Receipt/transaction encoding

3. **obligation_gap** and **code_gap**: Left empty for all obligations as the implementation adequately covers all spec requirements without ambiguity

**Verification:**
- Input row count: 40
- Output row count: 40 ✓
- All rows have code_flow filled: 40/40 ✓
- All rows have enforcement_type filled: 40/40 ✓
