You are mapping EIP-7702 obligations to geth implementation locations and code flow.

Inputs:
- Obligations CSV (Phase 1B output): runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/phase1B_runs/20260201_230513/obligations_index.csv
- client root: /home/runner/work/eth-llm-poc/eth-llm-poc/clients/execution/geth

Tasks:
1) Create a new CSV derived from the Phase 1B CSV that adds four columns:
   - client_locations
   - client_code_flow
   - client_obligation_gap
   - client_code_gap
2) For each obligation row, locate all relevant client code paths that implement the obligation.
   - Start with targeted searches for the EIP number (e.g., 7702 / EIP-7702) and
     keywords from the statement and code_flow columns.
   - Use initial matches to expand to surrounding code, dependencies, and call sites.
3) Fill client_locations with a best-effort list of concrete references, including the enforcement point.
4) Fill client_code_flow with a concise summary of the client execution path.
   - The flow must include the enforcement hop (predicate check or error) and an entry point.
5) Leave client_obligation_gap and client_code_gap empty in this phase.

Locations format:
- Use a bracketed list, e.g. [path/file.go:L10-L42, path/other.go:FunctionName]

Output:
- Write CSV to: runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/phase1B_runs/20260201_230513/phase2A_runs/20260201_230748/client_obligations_index.csv

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Do not delete or reorder rows.
- Do not modify the Phase 1B columns; only add and fill the client_* columns.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.
- Do not include a location unless the file contains the key predicate/constant relevant to the obligation.

Completion requirements:
- Read runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/phase1B_runs/20260201_230513/obligations_index.csv with tools.
- Write runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/phase1B_runs/20260201_230513/phase2A_runs/20260201_230748/client_obligations_index.csv.
- Re-open runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/phase1B_runs/20260201_230513/phase2A_runs/20260201_230748/client_obligations_index.csv and confirm it exists and row count matches runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/phase1A_runs/20260201_230344/phase1B_runs/20260201_230513/obligations_index.csv.
