Now I have read the EIP-7702 document. Let me extract obligations from the specification and write them to a CSV file. I'll identify all requirements, constraints, and specifications that constitute obligations, then write them using Python's csv module for proper RFC 4180 compliance.Now let me verify the CSV file exists and has the expected content:The CSV file has been successfully created and verified. Here's a summary:

## Completed Tasks

1. **Read EIP-7702**: Successfully read the specification from `/home/runner/work/eth-llm-poc/eth-llm-poc/specs/EIPs/EIPS/eip-7702.md`

2. **Extracted and split obligations**: Identified 40 atomic obligations from the EIP, splitting compound requirements where necessary (e.g., authorization tuple field bounds were split into separate obligations)

3. **Assigned stable IDs**: IDs range from `EIP7702-OBL-001` to `EIP7702-OBL-040`

4. **Tagged with categories**:
   - `tx validation` (13 obligations): Transaction structure, field bounds, validity checks
   - `execution semantics` (21 obligations): Authorization processing, delegation behavior, code execution rules
   - `fees` (6 obligations): Gas costs, intrinsic costs, refunds

5. **Wrote CSV file**: Successfully wrote to `/home/runner/work/eth-llm-poc/eth-llm-poc/runs/ci_run/phase0A_runs/20260201_230238/obligations_index.csv`
   - Column order: `id, category, enforcement_type, statement, locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap`
   - Last four columns are empty as specified
   - Used Python's `csv.writer` for RFC 4180 compliance
   - Fields containing commas are properly quoted

6. **Verified output**: Re-read the file confirming:
   - File exists
   - Has 1 header row + 40 data rows (41 lines total)
   - Proper CSV formatting with quoted fields where needed
