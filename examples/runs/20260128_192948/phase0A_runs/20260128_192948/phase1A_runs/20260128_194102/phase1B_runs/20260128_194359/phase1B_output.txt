I'll help you complete the code flow and gap analysis for EIP-1559 obligations. Let me start by reading the input CSV file to understand the current state of the data.Now let me read the relevant source files to understand the code paths. I'll start by reading the main files referenced in the obligations.EIP-1559 was introduced in the London fork. Let me read the London fork implementation:Now let me read the transactions.py and blocks.py files:Now let me check the VM instructions to understand the GASPRICE opcode:Perfect! Now I have enough context. Let me create a Python script to analyze each obligation and fill in the missing fields. I'll write a comprehensive analysis script:Now let's run the analysis script:Perfect! Let's verify the output by reading a sample of the updated CSV:Let's check one of the obligations with gaps to verify the gap analysis:
