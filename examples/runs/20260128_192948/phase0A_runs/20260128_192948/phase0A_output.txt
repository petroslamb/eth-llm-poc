## Summary

I have successfully extracted obligations from EIP-1559 and created a CSV index with **34 obligations**. Here's what was done:

### Process:
1. **Read the EIP-1559 specification** from the provided file path
2. **Extracted and split obligations** into atomic statements from the specification text and reference implementation
3. **Assigned stable IDs** in sequential order (EIP1559-OBL-001 through EIP1559-OBL-034)
4. **Tagged each obligation** with appropriate categories and enforcement types

### Categories Used:
- **block validation** (12 obligations) - Block structure, gas limits, base fee validation
- **tx validation** (13 obligations) - Transaction format, signature, balance checks
- **base fee adjustment** (4 obligations) - Base fee calculation rules
- **execution semantics** (4 obligations) - Priority fee, effective gas price, refunds, transaction ordering
- **fees** (2 obligations) - Miner compensation and base fee burning

### Enforcement Types:
- **consensus** - 32 obligations that MUST be enforced for consensus
- **empty** - 2 obligations (SHOULD recommendations) that are not consensus-critical

### Output:
The CSV file has been written to:
```
/Users/petros/Projects/eth-llm/poc4_7/notes/generated/20260128_192948/phase0A_runs/20260128_192948/obligations_index.csv
```

The file follows RFC 4180 CSV format with proper quoting for fields containing commas, and has the exact column order specified:
- id, category, enforcement_type, statement, locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap

The last four columns (locations, code_flow, obligation_gap, code_gap) are empty as requested, ready to be populated in later phases.
