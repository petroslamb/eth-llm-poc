Now I'll analyze the EIP text and extract the obligations. Let me identify the key requirements:

1. **Transaction type**: `TransactionType` must be `1`
2. **Transaction format**: Must be `rlp([chainId, nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS])`
3. **Signature computation**: Must be over `keccak256(0x01 || rlp([chainId, nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList]))`
4. **Receipt format**: Must be `rlp([status, cumulativeGasUsed, logsBloom, logs])`
5. **Access list validation**: Must be of type `[[{20 bytes}, [{32 bytes}...]]...]`
6. **Gas charging for addresses**: `ACCESS_LIST_ADDRESS_COST` (2400) gas per address
7. **Gas charging for storage keys**: `ACCESS_LIST_STORAGE_KEY_COST` (1900) gas per storage key
8. **Timing of gas charge**: At the beginning of execution (same time as start gas charge)
9. **Loading into global sets**: Addresses and storage keys must be loaded into `accessed_addresses` and `accessed_storage_keys`
10. **No per-byte fee**: Access list is NOT charged per-byte fees

Let me write the CSV using Python to ensure proper formatting:The CSV file has been successfully created and verified. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

I extracted **19 obligations** from EIP-2930 (Optional access lists) and wrote them to the CSV file.

### Obligations by Category:

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| tx validation | 10 |
| fees | 5 |
| execution semantics | 2 |
| block validation | 1 |

### Key Obligations Extracted:

1. **Transaction Format**: TransactionType must be 1, with specific RLP encoding for payload, signature, and receipt
2. **Access List Validation**: Detailed structural requirements (20-byte addresses, 32-byte storage keys, list format)
3. **Gas Charging**: 
   - 2400 gas per address (ACCESS_LIST_ADDRESS_COST)
   - 1900 gas per storage key (ACCESS_LIST_STORAGE_KEY_COST)
   - Charged at beginning of execution
   - Duplicates are charged multiple times
   - No per-byte fees for access lists
4. **Execution Semantics**: Access list contents must be loaded into `accessed_addresses` and `accessed_storage_keys` global sets
5. **Activation**: Only valid from FORK_BLOCK 12244000

The CSV file is properly formatted with RFC 4180 compliant quoting (commas in statements are properly quoted) and includes all 8 required columns, with the last 4 columns left empty as specified.
