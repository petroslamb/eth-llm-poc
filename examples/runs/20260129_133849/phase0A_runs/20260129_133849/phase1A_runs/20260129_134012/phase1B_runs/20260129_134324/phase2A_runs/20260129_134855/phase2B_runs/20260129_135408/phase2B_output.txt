Let me read the geth client codebase to validate and expand the analysis for each obligation. I'll start by examining key files that were referenced in the CSV.Let me also check more files for additional obligations:Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the geth codebase for EIP-1559 implementation. Let me create the output directory and write the updated CSV with refined client code analysis:Now let me verify the output file and compare row counts:The gap analysis is complete. Here's a summary of the work performed:

## Summary: Geth EIP-1559 Gap Analysis

### Task Completed
I analyzed 36 EIP-1559 obligations from the input CSV against the geth client codebase and updated the `client_*` fields with verified implementation details.

### Key Findings

**All obligations have matching client implementations** with validated code locations and flows. Notable observations:

1. **Well-Covered Areas:**
   - Transaction type detection and encoding (DynamicFeeTxType = 0x02)
   - Base fee calculation algorithm in `consensus/misc/eip1559/eip1559.go`
   - Effective gas price computation in `state_transition.go`
   - Intrinsic gas calculation with correct constants
   - Fee validation (tip vs feeCap, feeCap vs baseFee)
   - Balance checks and gas deduction flow

2. **Minor Gaps Identified:**
   - **EIP1559-OBL-007** (`client_code_gap`): Gas used vs gas limit validation is implicit through GasPool exhaustion rather than an explicit header check
   - **EIP1559-OBL-030** (`client_code_gap`): Fork transition handles gas limit doubling in `VerifyEIP1559Header` but `CalcBaseFee` returns fixed `InitialBaseFee`

3. **Client-Specific Implementation Details:**
   - Geth uses `msg.GasPrice` to store the effective gas price (computed as `min(GasTipCap + baseFee, GasFeeCap)`)
   - Legacy/EIP-2930 transaction normalization is achieved through accessor methods (`gasTipCap()`, `gasFeeCap()`) returning `GasPrice`
   - Fee burning is implicit (base fee deducted but never credited)
   - The 256-bit limit checks use `BitLen() > 256` validation
