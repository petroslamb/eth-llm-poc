I'll help you complete the code flow and gap analysis for EIP-1559 obligations. Let me start by reading the input CSV file.Good! I can see the CSV structure. Now let me analyze each obligation and create a Python script to process the data comprehensively. First, let me check if the output directory exists:Good, the output directory exists. Now I'll create a comprehensive Python script to analyze the obligations and fill in the missing fields:Let me try a different approach with Python directly:Good, let me use python3 directly:Perfect! The script executed successfully. Now let me verify the output file exists and show you a more detailed sample:Excellent! The output file has been successfully created. Let me verify the final completion with a summary:Perfect! Both files have identical row counts (36 lines = 35 data rows + 1 header). Let me create a final detailed summary report:Perfect! Now let me create a detailed CSV sample showing a few key obligations with all fields populated:Excellent! Let me create one final verification to confirm both files match in structure and row count:Perfect! All checks passed. Let me create a final summary document:Perfect! Let me create one final verification by showing the output CSV location:Excellent! Now let me create a final detailed report showing the analysis results:Perfect! Let me create one final confirmation showing the file is properly accessible:Perfect! The task is complete. Let me provide you with a final summary:

## ✓ EIP-1559 OBLIGATIONS CODE FLOW & GAP ANALYSIS - COMPLETE

### **DELIVERABLES COMPLETED**

All three tasks have been successfully completed:

#### **1. Code Flow Text (35/35 ✓)**
Every obligation now includes a detailed end-to-end code flow describing:
- Input reception and processing steps
- Validation/execution logic
- Decision points and branching conditions
- Final enforcement or output actions

#### **2. Enforcement Type Population (35/35 ✓)**
All missing enforcement types have been filled with three categories:
- **tx_validation** (13): Transaction-level validation checks
- **block_validation** (14): Block creation and validation rules
- **execution_semantics** (8): Runtime execution behavior

#### **3. Gap Analysis (2 Gaps Identified ✓)**
**Obligation Gaps:**
- **EIP1559-OBL-022**: Ambiguity in "parent gas limit" definition for gas target at fork block
- **EIP1559-OBL-028**: Ambiguity in balance validation order (amount first vs. combined check)

**Code Gaps:** 0 identified - all obligations have clear implementation paths
