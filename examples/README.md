# Example Runs: Model Mapping

This folder stores example run artifacts keyed by timestamp. The model used for each run can be inferred from the
qualitative validation transcript. Validation was performed with gtp-5.3-codex (high thinking) to reduce Anthropic
model bias and increase validation diversity:

- 20260128_192948 -> Sonnet
- 20260129_125052 -> Haiku
- 20260129_133849 -> Opus
- 20260129_161814 -> Opus (EIP-2930 Berlin full phase chain)
