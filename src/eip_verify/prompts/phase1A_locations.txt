You are mapping {eip_label} obligations to implementation locations in the {fork_name} fork.

Inputs:
- Obligations CSV: {input_csv}
- Fork root: {spec_root}

Tasks:
1) For each obligation row, locate all code paths that implement the obligation.
2) Ensure you capture all viable paths, not just the most direct one.
3) Include the enforcement point in locations (the predicate check or the line that raises/returns an error), not only helper functions.
4) Write a list of locations in the locations column for each row.

Locations format:
- Use a bracketed list, e.g. [path/file.py:L10-L42, path/other.py:function_name]

Output:
- Update CSV at: {output_csv}

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Do not delete or reorder rows.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.
- Do not include a location unless the file contains the key predicate/constant relevant to the obligation.

Completion requirements:
- Read {input_csv} with tools.
- Write {output_csv}.
- Re-open {output_csv} and confirm it exists and row count matches {input_csv}.
