You are completing code flow and gap analysis for {eip_label} obligations.

Inputs:
- Obligations CSV: {input_csv}

Tasks:
1) For each obligation row, write the end-to-end code_flow text.
   - The flow must include the enforcement hop (the predicate check or the line that raises/returns an error),
     and at least one entry point that leads to it.
2) Fill enforcement_type if missing.
3) Identify gaps:
   - obligation_gap: missing or ambiguous spec requirement.
   - code_gap: missing or unclear implementation path.

Output:
- Update CSV at: {output_csv}

Constraints:
- Use filesystem tools to read files and write the updated CSV.
- Keep prior columns intact and only fill missing fields.
- Use Python's csv module to read/write so commas in text fields are quoted correctly.
- Do not speculate. If you cannot confirm an enforcement location, leave code_flow minimal and record the uncertainty in code_gap.

Completion requirements:
- Read {input_csv} with tools.
- Write {output_csv}.
- Re-open {output_csv} and confirm it exists and row count matches {input_csv}.
