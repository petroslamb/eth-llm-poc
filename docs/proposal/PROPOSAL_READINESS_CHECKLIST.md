# Proposal Readiness Checklist (RFP)

This checklist tracks readiness for the RFP submission. The active deliverable is **PoC 5** (repo root).

## Status Legend
- **ready**: complete and documented
- **draft**: documented but needs validation or expansion
- **needs input**: vendor-specific data required
