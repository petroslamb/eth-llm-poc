# Proposal Readiness Checklist (RFP)

This checklist tracks readiness for the RFP submission. The active deliverable is **PoC 5** (`poc5/`).

## Status Legend
- **ready**: complete and documented
- **draft**: documented but needs validation or expansion
- **needs input**: vendor-specific data required

## Core Deliverables

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical architecture and design documented | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN.md`, `poc5/docs/POC_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` |
| End-to-end prototype demonstrated on execution-specs + geth | ready | `poc5/docs/POC_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`, `poc5/examples/` |
| Integration guidelines for GitHub CI/CD | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` |
| Documentation for setup, maintenance, and extension | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/OPERATIONS_AND_EXTENSION.md`, `poc5/README.md` |

## RFP Objectives Coverage

| Reliability (retry, partial-run summaries, deterministic artifacts) | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/EVALUATION_CRITERIA_RESPONSE.md` |
| Security and data hygiene (redaction, secret handling) | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/EVALUATION_CRITERIA_RESPONSE.md` |
| Cost and timeline estimates | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/BUDGET_AND_COST_STRUCTURE.md`, `poc5/docs/proposal/PROJECT_PLAN_AND_TIMELINE.md` |

## Proposal Requirements (Non-Technical)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vendor background summarized | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/VENDOR_BACKGROUND_AND_REFERENCES.md` |
| Project plan and milestones defined | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/PROJECT_PLAN_AND_TIMELINE.md` |
| Budget and cost structure outlined | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/BUDGET_AND_COST_STRUCTURE.md` |
| References or case studies provided | ready | `poc5/docs/proposal/VENDOR_BACKGROUND_AND_REFERENCES.md` |
